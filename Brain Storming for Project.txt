What can I do with stock market data:
On a broad level perspective:
1. Trained the model to differentiate ETFs from stocks (supervised learning)
2. Train the model to cluster the stocks + ETFs using unsupervised learning 
3. Train a machine learning model to decide on the list of stocks to choose from to attain a certain volatility 


On a specific level in an individual market data:
1. Forecasting future level (Supervised learning)
2. Smoothen out and reduce the data to hasten the training process by doing moving averages across like for example one week to predict weekly return
3. Using a subset of stocks that are in the same stock to predict future values, how's the prediction compared to using the sole stocks' historical data to make a prediction?
4. Utilizing the ability of the ARIMA to provide a confidence interval for the stock market price forecasting, we are able to judge if we can invest in a stock by the lower bound of the stock prediction. E.g. if the lower bound is consistently higher than the previous price, then we are safe to go.
5. Classifying if the stock is going up and down in a certain period. Make into a classification problem 



Feature Engineering variables:
1. Aroon Oscillator
2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
3. Bollinger Bands
4. PVT (Price Volume trend)
5. Price Range (High - Low) for a day or across the whole period
